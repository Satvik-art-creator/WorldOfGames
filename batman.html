<i><h1>Batman Arkham</h1></i>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xl-6 col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-12">
	<p><i><span class="font-weight-bold">Batman: Arkham</span> (also commonly known by the fan-originated term Arkhamverse) is a series of action-adventure video games based on the DC Comics character Batman, developed by Rocksteady Studios and WB Games Montr√©al, and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The first two Rocksteady games were written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini and featured voice actors Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker, respectively, from the DC Animated Universe (DCAU). Conroy and Hamill returned to voice their characters in the fourth main installment of the series, Batman: Arkham Knight. The franchise consists of four main titles, with additional mobile games, and a virtual reality game, Batman: Arkham VR, also developed by Rocksteady.

	The first game, Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), is set on Arkham Island, which houses the eponymus Arkham Asylum, home of Batman's greatest villains. Its story centers around Batman facing his archenemy, the Joker, who has taken over Arkham and trapped Batman inside with his incarcerated foes, while threatening Gotham City with hidden bombs. Players assume the role of Batman and must defeat the escaped inmates, while also uncovering a plot orchestrated by the Joker involving a super-steroid called "Titan". The second game, Batman: Arkham City (2011), is set one year later, within the titular Arkham City, a new super-prison based in the decaying urban slums of Gotham. When Batman is incarcerated in the prison, he must uncover a sinister scheme orchestrated by Arkham City's warden, Hugo Strange, while also contending with other villains taking advantage of the prison's lawlessness, including the Joker, who is slowly dying from a disease inflicted by the unstable Titan, and forces Batman to find a cure by infecting him as well. The third main game in the series, Batman: Arkham Origins (2013), serves as a prequel set fives years before Arkham Asylum, and follows a younger and less-refined Batman, who becomes the target of eight deadly assassins hired by crime lord Black Mask to kill him on Christmas Eve; he must also contend with the Gotham City police, who attempt to hunt him down, and other villains taking advantage of the chaos, including the Joker, whom Batman encounters for the first time. The fourth and final installment, Batman: Arkham Knight (2015), set nine months after Arkham City, sees Scarecrow forcing a citywide evacuation in Gotham and uniting some of Batman's greatest enemies in an attempt to destroy him once and for all, aided by the mysterious Arkham Knight; while working with his allies to defeat the villains and restore justice to Gotham, Batman must also contend with an illness caused by the late Joker, which is slowly transforming him into the Joker.

	The main installments in the Batman Arkham series have been met with widespread critical acclaim, with praise for their narratives, voice acting, world design, graphics, and gameplay systems and design, along with the faithfulness to the source material.</i></p></div>
